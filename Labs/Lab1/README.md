# Lab 1 - Raspberry Pi

## Lab 1A

1. I picked up the raspberry pi from Professor Dr. Lu, and I was provided with a microsd card with raspberry pi OS installed already (thank you), so it was a simple setup.
2. I'm using the raspberry pi in my house, so the internal IP is for there. 
   - Local IP: 192.168.1.156

## Lab 1B: Raspberry Pi Configuration

1. Changed the hostname to rpi, internet explorer is working but slow
2. images

## Lab 1C: Startup Mailer

1. Setting up the folder and mailer was easy enough, and it did actually work when activated from the command line, but it would not email on startup. I'm not sure why, but it's only on startup that it wouldnt work. Either way, it shouldn't be necessary since it's going to be on my local network with a very consistnent internal IP.
